â€œAir pollution has long been thought to be linked to a higher risk of lung cancer in people who have never smoked. Scientists say they have identified the mechanism through which air pollution triggers lung cancer. The research has sparked fresh calls for more urgent action to combat climate change.Previous research has shown that the DNA mutations can be present without causing cancer - and that most environmental carcinogens do not cause the mutations. But Swanton's study proposes a different model.When a cell is exposed to pollution it can trigger a "wound-healing response" that causes inflammation. And if that cell "harbours a mutation, it will then form a cancer""This opens a huge door, both for knowledge but also for new ways to prevent" cancer from developing, says Delaloge. Swanton calls air pollution a "hidden killer", pointing to research estimating it is linked to the deaths of more than eight million people a year."Given that probably five times as many people are exposed to unhealthy levels of pollution than tobacco, you can see this is quite a major global problem," he added.
